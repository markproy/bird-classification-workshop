# bird-classification-workshop
Machine learning is a game-changing technology with vast potential in every industry, yet many teams struggle with how to get started. In this “train the trainer” workshop, we share a sample project you can use with your customers and internal teams to have fun while diving deep on deep learning. You will get hands-on experience using Amazon SageMaker to build and deploy a neural network based on a publicly available dataset of 48,000 bird images.

You will also create a custom project for AWS DeepLens that detects birds and triggers species identification. By the end of the workshop, you will have a working end-to-end solution. Prerequisites: hands-on experience with Python, AWS Lambda, Amazon SNS, and Amazon S3 are required to get the most value from the workshop.

The workshop is composed of the following 6 labs:

* [Lab 1](lab1-image-prep.md) - Prepare images for training
* [Lab 2](lab2-train-model.md) - Train the classification model
* [Lab 3](lab3-host-model.md) - Host the trained model and identify your first bird!
* [Lab 4](lab4-trigger-inference-from-s3.md) - Trigger an inference as new pictures arrive in S3
* [Lab 5](lab5-deeplens-detect-and-classify.md) - Use AWS DeepLens to detect birds and trigger classification
* [Lab 6](lab6-text-notification.md) - Configure text notification with identified species (optional)
