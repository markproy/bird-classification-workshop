# Lab 3 - Host the inference model and identify your first bird!

In this lab, you will host the inference model and identify your first bird!  Here are the steps:

1. Create a SageMaker model from the training artifacts
2. Create a SageMaker endpoint configuration
3. Create a SageMaker endpoint
4. Test your model using the endpoint
